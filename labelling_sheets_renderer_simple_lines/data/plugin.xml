                <h3>Description of Simple Lines renderer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This renderer puts one field on each line.</li>
                    <li>
                        If the text is too wide for the label then the font size is
                        reduced until it fits.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Configuration</h3>
                <p>
                    You should put in Renderer Config field a single JSON or YAML
                    object that looks something like this:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    {"lines": ["o.field1", "o.field2.name", ...],
                     "mapped": "order_line"}
                </pre>

                <h4>lines (required)</h4>
                <p>
                    The object must have the key "lines" whose value is a
                    an array of Python expressions.<br/>

                    The variable "o" in those expressions represents the
                    Odoo record that is to be rendered on the current label.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note if the field is a numeric one, use this:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    "'{}'.format(o.price_unit)"
                </pre>

                <h4>mapped (optional)</h4>
                <p>
                    The object may also have an optional field "mapped"
                    whose value is the name of a field on your object.
                    If you provide this, then instead of getting labels
                    on the selected records, you will get labels on
                    all children of the selected records following these
                    fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So say your template is bound to the 'sale.order' object.

                    If "mapped" is set to "order_line", then if you select
                    one or more sale orders and print the labels for it then
                    o will be bound, in turn, to each of the members of the
                    One2many field order_line on each of the selected sale orders.
                </p>

                <h4>font_size (optional, default=12)</h4>
                <p>
                    Specify the font size in points. Integer.  Defaults to 12.
                </p>
                <h4>line_gap (optional, default=6)</h4>
                <p>
                    Specify the gap to put between lines in points.
                    Integer.  Defaults to 6.
                </p>
                <h4>font_name (optional, default="Helvetica")</h4>
                <p>
                    The name of the font to use.  String. Defaults to "Helvetica".
                    Note that this is restricted
                    to the fonts that are made available by ReportLab.
