# Print on Labelling Sheets
## Purpose

Provides an action 'More -> Print Sheet Labels' which will allow you to print
labels for one or more objects from the Odoo GUI.

This uses the pyLabels module to lay your labels out on a page.

All you need to do is provide code to draw on each label.

The layout of the label sheets is configurable in the database.

The system is designed to be extensible with renderers, so you can
draw on your labels anything supported by reportlab (assuming it will
physically fit on one of the labels) by writing code in an
Odoo addon.

## Limitations

* There is not currently a renderer that takes options from the database,
so you need to hard-code your per-label printing logic in a model.
  * Therefore this is not currently going to work for people on cloud instances.
  * However, with some extra development work it should be possible to write
a plugin that takes parameters from your template object, defining which fields
to render and which fonts you wish to use.
